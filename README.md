# edX_Learn_to_Program_in_Java
Final project for the Microsoft course on edX: DEV276x


This program navigates through a given maze. There are pits (0) and walls (-) that block the path of the user. 
If the user attempts to move through a wall or a pit Maze throws an exception and terminates the program.

The project consists of 2 classes: Maze (provided by the course) and MazeRunner (written by me).  
The Maze class has all of the methods and information needed to build a specific maze and have a MazeRunner get from the start to the end.
